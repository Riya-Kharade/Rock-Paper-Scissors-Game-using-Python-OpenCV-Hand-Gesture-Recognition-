# 🪨✋✂️ Rock Paper Scissors - AI Hand Gesture Game

A fun, interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Computer Vision**. This project uses **real-time hand gesture recognition** to play the classic game against the computer, making it a great example of combining AI with gaming.

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

This project uses your webcam and detects hand signs for Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The system then compares your choice with the computer's random choice and displays the result on the screen.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **cvzone**
- **HandTrackingModule (from cvzone)**

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition 🖐️  
- Rock, Paper, and Scissors detection 🪨📄✂️  
- Score tracking system  
- 3-second countdown before each round  
- Fun UI with visual feedback and game status  

---

## 📦 How It Works

1. **Hand Detection**: Uses `cvzone.HandTrackingModule` to detect your hand.
2. **Game Start**: A countdown timer appears, giving you 3 seconds to show your hand gesture.
3. **Computer Move**: The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
4. **Result**: The game compares gestures and updates the score.
